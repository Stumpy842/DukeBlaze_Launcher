**DukeBlaze** is a Launcher for eDuke32 that will allow you to easily run custom maps and modifications, and build your own collection. 

Unfortunately I have not found on the Internet a convenient launcher for Duke Nukem 3D, which would allow in two clicks to run various user-generated content and even more to compose their own collection. As a result, I came up with the idea of creating such a launcher primarily for myself and my friends. It would allow me to share a ready-made, pre-configured library of user-generated content for the game. It's still in the early stages of development, but the core functionality is already working and I'd like to share the results of my work with you. Hope you'll like it :)
